Movie Recommender System using Machine Learning (Streamlit App)

This project is an end-to-end Movie Recommender System built using machine learning and deployed via a Streamlit web application. The system provides personalized movie suggestions based on content similarity, enabling users to discover films similar to the ones they like. It uses metadata from the TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits datasets and employs text-based feature engineering, TF-IDF vectorization for recommendation generation.
